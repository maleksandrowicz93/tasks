This solution always checks commit in the middle of whole commits scope.
If commit is correct, it is known that first incorrect commit is in 2nd half of scope.
But if commit is incorrect, it is known that first incorrect commit is in 1st half of scope.
So, my solutions always checks midpoint commit and in case of result of correctness checking, scope is reduced into one of halfs.
Thanks for that number of attempts is related to powers of number 2.
Accordingly, we need only from 8 to 10 attempts so, it will take us minimum 80 minutes and maximum 100 minutes.
